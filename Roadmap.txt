-learn the current new code
-delete old branches, back to master only, then branch that one out. Prepare a branch to fix this problem below:
-Understand why it's outputting things wrong (Does fine if you drop the .dropna(), probably need to remove that, and only drop the NaN after you iterate through 'em.)
-Fix that problem
-After that's done, future things to add to it to make it better
(graphs, visiuals, sums of the columns, total # trades, total p_l for strategy either per stock or for all stocks, etc.)
(perhaps fixing the clunkier parts of the code the entries df, probably can just make that a dictionary much easier)
(probably dont even need to download .csv files, seems kinda useless)
